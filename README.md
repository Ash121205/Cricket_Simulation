# Cricket_Simulation

This repository contains a Python code that simulates a single over of cricket. The code uses the random function to generate the runs scored on each ball. The commentary for each ball is also generated by the code.

## Methodology

The code uses the following methodology to simulate a single over of cricket:

1. A list of players is created.
2. A field is created.
3. An umpire is created.
4. A commentator is created.


For each ball:
- The runs scored on the ball are generated randomly.
- The commentary for the ball is generated.

The total runs scored in the over are printed out.

## Instructions on how to run the code

To run the code, you will need to have Python installed on your computer. Once you have Python installed, you can run the code by following these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your computer.
2. Open command prompt in the folder that your cloned the repository into.
